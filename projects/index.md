For my Insight project I created [beersomme], a bar recommender app based on beer preference.
I scraped beer descriptions from [Ratebeer] and extracted keywords relevant to the flavor of each beer.
Using these features, I found which beers were most similar to each other.
To find nearby beers, I used local beer check-in information from [Untappd] to act as a proxy for beer lists.
By combining these data sources, I provide recommendations to the user on where to get their next beer.
