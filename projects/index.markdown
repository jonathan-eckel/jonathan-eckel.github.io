For my Insight project I created [beersomme],
 a bar recommender app based on beer preference. 
I scraped beer descriptions from [Ratebeer] and extracted keywords relevant to the flavor of each beer.  Using these features, I found which beers were most similar to each other. 
To find nearby beers, I used local beer check-in information from [Untappd] to act as a proxy for beer lists.
By combining these data sources, I provide recommendations to the user on where to get their next beer.


## PhD Projects

#### Dissertation:
Searching for Supersymmetry at the LHC: Studies of Sleptons and Stops

#### Advisor:
Shufang Su

My PhD work falls under the category of Particle Phenomenology. The study of phenomenology is concerned with the interplay between theory and experiment.  I studied the theory of Supersymmetry and how aspects of this theory could present themselves in data collected at the Large Hadron Collider, the particle experiment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.
