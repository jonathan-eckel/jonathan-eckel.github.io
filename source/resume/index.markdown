## Work Experience

### Splash
_Data Scientist_, May 2017 - Present

As a hybrid Data Scientist / Data Engineer, my focus is building data products for internal and external use.  I am responsible for building and maintaining data infrastructure for ETL pipelines and data products.

#### Relevant Projects:

Build and Maintain the Data Warehouse
- Constructed a Redshift data warehouse with internal and external data sources for a unified data view of our users, clients and guests.
- Champion the use of Apache Airflow to orchestrate all of Splash's ETL jobs.

Data Science Prototypes:
- Created an ROI dashboard for clients to surface success metrics of events.  For B2B clients, we used Salesforce data to calculate opportunity generation and deals closed attributed to events hosted.
- Trained, tested and deployed a model to predict email opens by user. Provided support team predictors of large email send performance by clients.
