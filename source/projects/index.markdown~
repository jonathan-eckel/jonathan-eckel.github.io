For my Insight project I created [beersomme] [bs],
 a bar recommender app based on beer preference. I combined beer descriptions from [Ratebeer](http://www.ratebeer.com) and local taplist information from [Untappd](http://untappd.com) to provide recommendations to the user on where to get their next beer.

## PhD Projects

#### Dissertation:
Searching for Supersymmetry at the LHC: Studies of Sleptons and Stops

#### Advisor:
Shufang Su

My PhD work falls under the category of Particle Phenomenology. The study of phenomenology is concerned with the interplay between theory and experiment.  I studied the theory of Supersymmetry and how aspects of this theory could present themselves in data collected at the Large Hadron Collider, the particle experiment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.
