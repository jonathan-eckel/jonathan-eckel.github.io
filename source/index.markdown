I am currently an [Insight Data Science] [Insight] Fellow in New York.  At Insight I created [beersomme.com] [beersomme], a bar recommender app based on beer preference.
Previously, I studied Particle Physics at the [University of Arizona] [UA]  and received
my PhD in 2014.  Here you'll find my resume and a summary of my PhD
work. This website will expand to include my other side projects and
interests.
