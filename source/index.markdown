I am currently an Insight Data Science Fellow in New York.  At Insight I created [beersomme.com](http://beersomme.com) a bar recommender app based on beer preference.
Previously I studied Particle Physics at the University of Arizona and received
my PhD in 2014.  Here you'll find my resume and a summary of my PhD
work. This website will expand to include my other side projects and
interests.
